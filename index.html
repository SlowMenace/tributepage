                <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Barry Allen aka the Flash's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>1989</strong> - Born in Central City, USA</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>1995</strong> -  Barry had begged his parents to take him to a science expo out of town, but on the way, they hit a flat tire, and their car had to be towed to the garage in a small town with a single street, and were stuck there all day, but they passed the time at the local diner where they had ice cream and french fries with gravy, and spent the night watching the local fireworks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>1999</strong> - Barry and his mother Nora watch Singin' in the Rain together.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2000</strong> - Leaving the Crisis of 2024, Reverse-Flash and the Flash traveled back into the year 2000 where Reverse-Flash attempted to kill an 11 year old Barry Allen. The Flash of 2024 stopped him, escaping with 11 year old Barry, so the Reverse-Flash killed Barry's mother Nora Allen and tried to return to his time. This changes the Flash's potential history, draining Eobard's connection to the Speed Force as a side-effect, and leaving him stranded in 2000. Refusing to accept the loss of his powers, Eobard decides to completely alter history and make Barry Allen into the Flash as soon as possible.
                    Henry Allen is charged with Nora's murder and sentenced to life in prison. Joe West takes legal guardianship of Barry Allen.
                    April 16, Knowing "future" events, Eobard Thawne follows Harrison Wells and his wife Tess Morgan and causes a car crash to occur, which kills Tess. Eobard uses a futuristic device to drain the DNA from Wells into himself, giving him Wells' appearance whilst killing Wells. Eobard then takes Wells' place and buries Wells' body to ensure the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator happens sooner.
                    May 29, Eobard Thawne masqueraded as Harrison Wells officially opens the S.T.A.R. Labs in Central City and begin to plan and build the particle accelerator to be released as soon possible.
                    
                </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2013</strong> - Barry Allen travels to Starling City and meets Oliver Queen and his team for the first time. December 11, the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator purposely "malfunctioned", creating numerous meta-humans in the process but at the expense of countless lives. Barry Allen is struck by lightning, and put into a coma for 9 months.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2014</strong> - Barry Allen wakes up from his coma and becomes "The Red Streak" or "The Streak"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2015</strong> - Barry Allen from 2016 travels back to 2015 to talk with Eobard Thawne/Harrison Wells, reasoning that his old mentor/enemy would know the secret of increasing speed if anyone did. Although his plan to simply pose as his past self failed due to the intervention of a Time Wraith, Barry was able to trick Eobard into providing him with the information he needed by claiming that Eobard would return home in his time and he had left information about Eobard's real identity where his past self would find it unless he was allowed to return to his own time. Due to actions of Barry's future self, Hartley Rathaway/Pied Piper became an ally of Team Flash instead of a villain. Barry reveals to Iris that he is the Flash and reveals how he feels about her. He then runs back and forth along the shore in order to stop Mark's tidal wave; causing a time rupture that sends him backwards in time to the previous day. Barry travels back in time to 2000 prevent his mom's murder but his future self warns him to not do so. Barry returns and fights against Eobard Thawne one more time. Eddie Thawne shoots himself to prevent Eobard from killing Team Flash and erases him from existence. This causes a huge time paradox that manifests as a singularity which threatens to obliterate the planet[3] and inadvertently opens a portal to Earth-2 Henry Allen is released from prison after Wells (Eobard) leaves Barry a prerecorded message confessing to the murder.
                    Barry comes up with a dangerous plan to capture Zoom using Linda Park and disguising her as Dr. Light. Zoom doesn't fall for the plan and he takes Linda as she is leaving work. Iris witnesses this and calls Barry while the S.T.A.R. Labs meta-human detector senses a meta-human on the roof. That meta-human turns out to be Zoom. Zoom and Barry fight and Zoom breaks Barry's back, paralyzing him. Zoom carries Barry around Central City showing that there hero, has failed to protect them. Cisco then shoots Zoom with the speed dampener and Zoom leaves.

                  <li>
                    <strong>2016</strong> - Barry chases Zoom throughout Central City and leads their conflict to the old Allen house in which Barry watches Zoom kill Henry.[99]
                    Time Rupture: May 24, Barry Allen travels back in time to 2000 and stops Eobard Thawne from killing Nora Allen.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2024</strong> - after several encounters, Barry Allen/The Flash teams up with Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, Ray Palmer/The Atom and Kendra Saunders/Hawkgirl to fight Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash in the streets of Central City, causing the most destruction the city has ever seen. The fight also somehow causes the sky to turn a deep crimson color, several trucks to start leaking their contents onto the streets and power outages spread over 20 blocks throughout the city. The speedsters start battling over two overturned tanker trucks, and the lightning emitted from them causes the oil from one of them to ignite. While surrounded by smoke, the speedsters have a very heated conversation on an unknown matter, then speed off leaving Green Arrow, Atom and Hawkgirl behind. The two then continue their fight up and down an unknown avenue before Flash vanishes without a trace.[5] However, unbeknownst to everyone, they both travel back to the year 2000.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2151</strong> - This was originally the year that Eobard Thawne was to be born. However, because of Eddie Thawne's suicide in 2015, he erased the entire Thawne family from existence, including Eobard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Flashpoint timeline</strong> -While imprisoned in the Speed Force, Barry Allen/Savitar sensed a dramatic shift in the timeline that resulted from his younger version of 2016 creating the Flashpoint timeline. Realizing that he could use the situation to his advantage, Barry waited until the timeline was restored to its previous form and began to enact his plan.
                    March 18,[74] Barry Allen (from the year 2016) arrives at this date and stops Eobard Thawne from killing his mother and succeeds in saving Nora Allen's life, all events that happen after 2000 are now dramatically altered into a new timeline.
                    Pre-Flashpoint Barry arrives in this timeline in a superseding form of time travel (replacing his Flashpoint self) and imprisons Eobard into a cage that dampened his speed and has a great life with his parents for the next three months.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Post-Flashpoint timeline</strong> - During his time imprisoned, the legend of Savitar was spread throughout the multiverse and across the timeline. With the lie of his power being the first speedster to ever be granted power to the Speed Force, he eventually became the fastest out of all of them, challenging other powerful speedsters who threatened his power to battle, before taking over their Earths. Before each encounter, Savitar would use the Philosopher's Stone's power to possess a person to use a medium under the "Alchemy" alias, to prepare for arrival, by creating meta-humans for him to command.[102]
                    Barry Allen is imprisoned in the Speed Force as a consequence for the Flashpoint.[67] In October 10, 2017, Barry is freed from the the prison.
                    The rogue time remnant of Barry Allen traveled there to find the Philosopher's Stone, in which he used it to create his armor and named himself "Savitar, the God of Speed".[102] He later traveled to the future to punish his original self and Team Flash for him being treated as an aberration.[55]
                    Wally West traveled to the ancient times and took a bassinet that belonged to Moses, in which he later gave to Joe and Cecile as a baby shower gift.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>2000 Post-Flashpoint</strong> - Barry Allen and Nora West-Allen travel back in time to watch Barry's parents on the porch of their house.[6]
                    Time Rupture: After Barry Allen/The Flash returned to 2000 in attempt to stop Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash from killing his mother, another version of Eobard, who Barry released from his prison in Flashpoint, appeared and taunts Barry by saying that his mother was not safe. Then the pre-Flashpoint version of Eobard and Barry disappear. While Nora was still pleading for her life, the other Eobard grabs a kitchen knife and stabs Nora in the heart therefore restoring the timeline to a state similar to that of the pre-Flashpoint timeline.

And I was right, it's not the same, but.... somehow, it's okay. Family isn't just the people you grew up with. It's the people you find, the ones you love, the ones that make you crazy, make you smile. "
